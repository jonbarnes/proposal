Debris flows are a hazard for roads and human lives. People die because of debris flows on roads.  

Debris flows are a problem in the world. 
“Debris flows cause significant damage and fatalities throughout the world. This study addresses the 
overall impacts of debris flows on a global scale from 1950 to 2011. Two hundred and thirteen events 
with 77,779 fatalities have been recorded from academic publications, newspapers, and personal 
correspondence.”

Debris flows and their toll on human life: a global analysis of debris-flow 
fatalities from 1950 to 2011
CA Dowling, PM Santi - Natural hazards, 2014 – Springer

Debris flows are a problem in Oregon. 
 “Thus, analysis has focused on recorded events that occurred from 1950 to the 
present. At least 21 deaths in Oregon have been attributed to debris flows since 
1950. The debris flow fatality rate averages about one fatality every five years for the 
entire population of Oregon. The risk of being killed by a debris flow in Oregon for 
the average citizen appears to be relatively low, about 0.02 fatalities per 100,000 
people per year. However, the risk appears to be significant and several orders of 
magnitude greater, up to 70 fatalities per 100,000 people per year, for small 
segments of the population known to be living, working, or traveling in identified 
areas of high or extreme debris flow hazard. The risk to any individual depends on 
their level of exposure, which is determined by their location in relation to the paths 
of potential debris flows and by how much time they spend in these locations.” -

Having sensors that detect landslides before they happen and warn people would be a valuable tool 
which could have the potential to save lives.
